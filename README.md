# SwiftUI-Projects

This repo contains a collection of SwiftUI apps I built while learning the framework. These apps cover a range of topics such as layout, views, navigation, data management, mapping, Core Data, graphics, and animation, making it a comprehensive resource for improving your SwiftUI skills. Each app is designed to showcase a specific technique or concept and includes code comments and documentation to help explain the implementation. Whether you're new to SwiftUI or looking to take your skills to the next level, this repo provides an excellent learning resource.
